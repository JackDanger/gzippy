# gzippy-dev Workflow

## Starting a Session

```bash
gzippy-dev score      # Current win/loss from cloud fleet
gzippy-dev losses     # Losses grouped by root cause
```

## Making a Change

1. Make ONE focused change
2. `cargo test --release` for correctness
3. `gzippy-dev ci push` — pushes, waits for CI, auto-triages
4. If CI looks good: `source .env && gzippy-dev cloud bench` for authoritative numbers

## When the Tool Is Missing Something

If you find yourself doing manual analysis, add the capability to `tools/devtool/src/`.

Description: The fastest parallel gzip
 Gzippy is a high-performance parallel gzip implementation written in Rust.
 It beats gzip and pigz by leveraging multiple CPU cores, SIMD instructions,
 and optimized compression libraries (libdeflate, zlib-ng).
 .
 Features:
  - Drop-in gzip replacement with compatible CLI
  - Parallel compression using all available cores
  - Memory-mapped I/O for zero-copy file access
  - Compatible output that works with all standard gzip tools
 .
 This package provides the gzippy and ungzippy commands.

Description: Replace system gzip with gzippy (fast parallel gzip)
 This package replaces the system gzip, gunzip, gzcat, and zcat commands
 with gzippy, providing significantly faster compression and decompression.
 .
 When installed, all system gzip operations will use gzippy transparently.
 This is fully compatible with standard gzip - files compressed with gzippy
 can be decompressed by any standard gzip implementation.
 .
 WARNING: This package conflicts with and replaces the gzip package.
 Install only if you want gzippy to handle all gzip operations system-wide.
